# MqttViz
An sample application to retrieve MQTT messages and display them in charts.

# How it works
The application connects to a MQTT broker and subscribes to a topic. Configure those variables in `index.js`.
As soon as a message is retrieved from the subscribed MQTT topic, it will publish this message via socket.io on Port 3000.

The index.html connects to the socket.io server and retrieves the messages. Finally the send values are getting displayed in a chart generated by Chart.js

# Installation & Usage
* Run `git clone` to clone the application to your local machine
* Run `npm install` to install needed dependecies
* edit both, MQTT connectionstring and topic in index.js
* Execute the server running `node index.js`
* Open `index.html` in a browser
